# Live-Project-on-CICD-Pipeline
Bootstrap infrastructure on AWS along with CI/CD for a client

Objectives:
  1.  Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.
  2.  Building a CICD pipeline using Jenkins.
  3.  System provisioning and configuration management using Ansible.
  4.  Orchestration of containers using Kubernetes.

Requirement:
A DevOps ninja needs to plan & bootstrap infrastructure on AWS along with basic CI/CD for a client. The client wants to have a Dockerized Node js app (monolith) running securely. The client expects to have a manageable, easy to configure and secure design for his infrastructure & CI/CD.

Considerations:
  1.  Terraform with a proper structure of codebase and state management for infrastructure provisioning.
  2.  Ansible for configuration management, for instance, installing ‘Docker’ on the hosts.
  3.  Jenkins to build the CICD pipeline for the deployment of node applications.
  4.  Github as a codebase repository and ECR for docker image repository.
